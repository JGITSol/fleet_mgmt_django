## Data Models and Core Functionality

### User and Account Management

The system implements a comprehensive role-based access control system with predefined roles common in the fleet management industry:

```python
# accounts/models.py
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser
from django.db import models

class UserRole(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    description = models.TextField()
    permissions = models.JSONField()

class User(AbstractUser):
    role = models.ForeignKey(UserRole, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True)
    phone_number = models.CharField(max_length=20, blank=True)
    emergency_contact = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True)
```

This model structure allows for flexible role assignment with fleet-specific permissions, supporting industry-standard roles like Fleet Managers, Maintenance Coordinators, Drivers, and Administrators[^11][^8].

### Vehicle Management

Vehicles are the central entity in the system, with comprehensive tracking capabilities:

```python
# vehicles/models.py
from django.db import models

class VehicleModel(models.Model):
    make = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    model = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    year = models.IntegerField()
    part_locations = models.JSONField(default=dict)
    
class Vehicle(models.Model):
    vehicle_model = models.ForeignKey(VehicleModel, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    license_plate = models.CharField(max_length=20, unique=True)
    vin = models.CharField(max_length=50, unique=True)
    status = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[
        ('active', 'Active'),
        ('maintenance', 'In Maintenance'),
        ('inactive', 'Inactive')
    ])
    current_odometer = models.IntegerField(default=0)
    fuel_efficiency = models.FloatField(null=True, blank=True)
    acquisition_date = models.DateField()
```

This structure allows tracking of vehicle status, current mileage, and efficiency metrics, providing the foundation for maintenance scheduling and fleet optimization[^1][^5].

### Odometer Reading Automation

One of the system's standout features is AI-powered odometer reading extraction:

```python
# ai_services/odometer/odometer_reader.py
import cv2
import torch
import easyocr

class OdometerReader:
    def __init__(self):
        # Load YOLOv8 model for odometer detection
        self.odometer_detector = torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov8', 'custom', 
                                               'models/odometer_detector.pt')
        # Initialize OCR reader
        self.reader = easyocr.Reader(['en'])
        
    def process_image(self, image_path, vehicle_id, db_connection):
        """Process an image to extract and validate the odometer reading"""
        # Preprocess image
        image = self.preprocess_image(image_path)
        
        # Detect odometer region
        odometer_region = self.detect_odometer(image)
        if odometer_region is None:
            return None, "No odometer detected in image"
        
        # Extract reading
        reading = self.extract_reading(odometer_region)
        if reading is None:
            return None, "Could not extract reading from odometer"
        
        # Validate reading
        is_valid, message = self.validate_reading(reading, vehicle_id, db_connection)
        
        if is_valid:
            return reading, message
        else:
            return None, message
```

This implementation can detect both analog and digital odometers, classify them, and extract readings with high accuracy. The system validates readings against historical data and applies common-sense rules to prevent errors[^2][^7][^12][^15].

### Damage Detection and Assessment

The damage detection system uses computer vision to identify damaged vehicle parts:

```python
# ai_services/damage_detection/damage_detector.py
class DamageDetector:
    def __init__(self):
        # Load YOLOv8 model for damage detection
        self.damage_detector = torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov8', 'custom', 
                                             'models/damage_detector.pt')
        # Define damage parts classes
        self.damage_classes = {
            0: 'Bumper', 1: 'Door', 2: 'Fender', 3: 'Hood', 
            4: 'Windshield', 5: 'Headlight', 6: 'Taillight'
        }
        
    def detect_damage(self, image):
        """Detect damaged parts in the image"""
        results = self.damage_detector(image)
        detections = results.pandas().xyxy[^0]
        
        damaged_parts = []
        for _, detection in detections.iterrows():
            class_id = int(detection['class'])
            part_name = self.damage_classes[class_id]
            confidence = detection['confidence']
            
            # Determine severity based on confidence
            severity = self._calculate_severity(confidence)
                
            damaged_parts.append({
                'part_name': part_name,
                'severity': severity,
                'confidence': float(confidence)
            })
        
        return damaged_parts
```

This system can automatically identify damaged parts, estimate repair costs, and recommend appropriate service actions, streamlining the damage reporting process[^10].

### Maintenance Management

The maintenance system tracks service history and schedules future maintenance:

```python
# maintenance/models.py
class MaintenanceType(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    description = models.TextField()
    interval_miles = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)
    interval_days = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)
    
class MaintenanceSchedule(models.Model):
    vehicle = models.ForeignKey(Vehicle, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    maintenance_type = models.ForeignKey(MaintenanceType, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    last_performed_date = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)
    last_performed_odometer = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)
    next_due_date = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)
    next_due_odometer = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)
```

The system automatically calculates due dates based on mileage readings and time intervals, sending notifications when maintenance is approaching[^1][^11].

## Emergency Assistance System

The 24/7 emergency helpdesk provides critical support for drivers:

```python
# emergency/models.py
from django.contrib.gis.db import models as gis_models

class EmergencyType(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    description = models.TextField()
    priority = models.IntegerField()
    
class EmergencyRequest(models.Model):
    driver = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    vehicle = models.ForeignKey(Vehicle, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    emergency_type = models.ForeignKey(EmergencyType, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    location = gis_models.PointField()
    timestamp = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    status = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[
        ('pending', 'Pending'),
        ('assigned', 'Assigned'),
        ('resolved', 'Resolved'),
        ('cancelled', 'Cancelled')
    ])
```

When a driver encounters an emergency, they can use the mobile app to request assistance. The system uses geospatial queries to find nearby service providers that can address the specific emergency type[^8][^16].

### API Integration and Data Flow

The system exposes comprehensive REST APIs for integration with mobile apps and third-party services:

```python
# api/urls.py
from django.urls import path, include
from rest_framework.routers import DefaultRouter
from . import views

router = DefaultRouter()
router.register(r'vehicles', views.VehicleViewSet)
router.register(r'odometer-readings', views.OdometerReadingViewSet)
router.register(r'maintenance', views.MaintenanceViewSet)
router.register(r'damage-reports', views.DamageReportViewSet)
router.register(r'emergency-requests', views.EmergencyRequestViewSet)

urlpatterns = [
    path('', include(router.urls)),
    path('ai/odometer/', views.ProcessOdometerImage.as_view()),
    path('ai/damage-detection/', views.ProcessDamageImage.as_view()),
    path('emergency/nearby-providers/', views.NearbyServiceProviders.as_view()),
    path('maintenance/due/', views.MaintenanceDue.as_view()),
]
```

These endpoints facilitate seamless communication between the mobile app used by drivers and the backend services, ensuring data flows efficiently throughout the system[^4].

## Project Implementation with Cookiecutter-uv

The project is structured using the cookiecutter-uv template, which provides a modern Python project foundation:

```bash
# Create project using cookiecutter-uv
uvx cookiecutter https://github.com/fpgmaas/cookiecutter-uv.git

# Project configuration
# project_name: Car Fleet Manager
# project_slug: car_fleet_manager
# python_version: 3.11
# use_src_layout: yes
# include_github_actions: yes
```

This template sets up the project with essential development tools including uv for dependency management, pre-commit hooks, code quality tools, and CI/CD integration via GitHub Actions[^13].

## Advanced Features and Industry Alignment

### Real-Time Vehicle Tracking

The system provides real-time tracking and route optimization capabilities:

```python
# tracking/models.py
from django.contrib.gis.db import models as gis_models

class LocationUpdate(models.Model):
    vehicle = models.ForeignKey('vehicles.Vehicle', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    timestamp = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    location = gis_models.PointField()
    speed = models.FloatField(null=True, blank=True)
    heading = models.FloatField(null=True, blank=True)
    
class Route(models.Model):
    vehicle = models.ForeignKey('vehicles.Vehicle', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    start_time = models.DateTimeField()
    end_time = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)
    distance = models.FloatField(null=True, blank=True)
    fuel_consumed = models.FloatField(null=True, blank=True)
```

This tracking system aligns with industry trends for 2025, focusing on real-time monitoring and route optimization to reduce costs and improve efficiency[^1][^8].

### Predictive Maintenance

The system implements AI-driven predictive maintenance to anticipate vehicle issues:

```python
# maintenance/predictive.py
class PredictiveMaintenance:
    def __init__(self, vehicle_id):
        self.vehicle_id = vehicle_id
        self.model = self._load_prediction_model()
    
    def predict_failures(self, telemetry_data):
        """Predict potential component failures based on telemetry data"""
        features = self._extract_features(telemetry_data)
        predictions = self.model.predict(features)
        
        return {
            'component_risks': predictions,
            'recommended_actions': self._get_recommendations(predictions)
        }
```

This aligns with the industry trend toward proactive maintenance scheduling based on vehicle-specific data and historical patterns[^1][^3][^11].

### Fuel Management and Efficiency Analysis

The system tracks fuel consumption and analyzes efficiency metrics:

```python
# vehicles/fuel.py
class FuelEfficiencyAnalyzer:
    def analyze_trends(self, vehicle_id, period_days=90):
        """Analyze fuel efficiency trends for a vehicle"""
        # Get fuel logs for the period
        fuel_logs = FuelLog.objects.filter(
            vehicle_id=vehicle_id,
            timestamp__gte=timezone.now() - timezone.timedelta(days=period_days)
        ).order_by('timestamp')
        
        # Calculate efficiency metrics
        return {
            'average_mpg': self._calculate_average_mpg(fuel_logs),
            'trend': self._calculate_efficiency_trend(fuel_logs),
            'anomalies': self._detect_efficiency_anomalies(fuel_logs)
        }
```

This aligns with the industry focus on fuel management and efficiency optimization for cost reduction and sustainability[^5][^16].

## Mobile Application Design

The mobile application provides a user-friendly interface for drivers to interact with the system:

```dart
// lib/screens/odometer/odometer_screen.dart
class OdometerScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _OdometerScreenState createState() =&gt; _OdometerScreenState();
}

class _OdometerScreenState extends State&lt;OdometerScreen&gt; {
  File? _imageFile;
  bool _isProcessing = false;
  String? _result;

  Future&lt;void&gt; _takePicture() async {
    final ImagePicker _picker = ImagePicker();
    final XFile? photo = await _picker.pickImage(source: ImageSource.camera);
    
    if (photo != null) {
      setState(() {
        _imageFile = File(photo.path);
        _isProcessing = true;
      });
      
      await _processImage();
    }
  }
  
  Future&lt;void&gt; _processImage() async {
    // Upload image to API
    final response = await ApiService.uploadOdometerImage(_imageFile!);
    
    setState(() {
      _isProcessing = false;
      _result = response.reading;
    });
  }
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // UI implementation
  }
}
```

The mobile app allows drivers to easily submit odometer readings, report damage, and request emergency assistance, all through an intuitive interface[^5][^6].
